## Consider the following tweaks:

### 'Panels' (menubars) arrangment: mac os'ish

1. Replace 'brisk' menu applet with MATE menu

2. Use 'Global Application Menu' (mac OS style menu bars)

3. Workspace switch on top

4. No other panels

Note: MATE menu can be customized. Time menu can be customized

### Mate / GTK themes

- Flat-Remix-Gtk-Green-Dark-Solid (`cp` themes to `~/.themes` to install)

- Icon Theme: Papirus-Dark (download has `install.sh` which moves it to `~/.icons`)

### Misc

- Use 'dock' (plank) from Mate tweak

  - Add internet browser, file browser, terminal, system settings, etc...

  - `ctrl-click` to customize in planck
  
  - hiding the planck icon may require a command line call
  
  - auto-hide is prefered to allow fullscreen to take full space still

- may need to add `source ~/.bash_profile` to bash rc so prompt/etc is included after
